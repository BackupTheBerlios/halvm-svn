HalVM 0.2 Release Notes
=======================

	This is the first official release of HalVM on BerliOS. There's nothing
much to say about it other than "Please go ahead and try it". This version
has been fairly well tested and should be considered beta-grade software.

	This release has the following limitations:

	- The HalVM daemon depends on PAM-console for setting the ownership of the
	  mounted volumes. This will be fixed in later versions.
	
	- Neither the HalVM daemon nor the HalVM-OSD tool is able to reconnect to
	  HAL. So if either DBUS or HAL is restarted, then HalVM and HalVM-OSD needs
	  to be restarted too. I hope to fix this at some point but it have a low
	  priority.

	- The documentation on the HalVM daemon is still somewhat sparse. This will
	  be fixed in later versions.
