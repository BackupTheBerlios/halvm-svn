Requirements
============

	The HalVM daemon has the following requirements:

	- Python (tested with Python 2.4)
	- HAL (tested with Hal 0.5.7)
	- DBUS with Python bindings (tested with DBUS 1.0.2 and DBUS-python 0.71)


	To use the HalVM-OSD notification tool you also need:

	- PyOSD (tested with PyOSD 0.2.14)
	- libXosd (tested with libXosd 2.2.14)


Basic Installation
==================

	HalVM comes with a simple Makefile which can do the installation for you.
If you just want to install everything in the package, then simply execute 
`make install'. This will install HalVM, HalVM-OSD (a small notification tool)
and some HAL policies. If you only want to install parts of HalVM (e.g. omit the
HAL policies), please see the next section.

	The Makefile is $DESTDIR aware, so you can use it with e.g. Portage (Gentoo's
package system).


Advanced Installation
=====================
    
	More advanced may want to only install parts of HalVM. This can be done as
following:

	1. Execute `make install_halvm' to install the HalVM daemon.

	2. Execute `make install_halvm-osd' to install the HalVM-OSD notification
	   tool.

	3. Execute `make install_policies' to install the HAL policies.


Starting HalVM (Gentoo users)
=============================

	HalVM comes with a rc-script for Gentoo Linux. Simply rc/halvm to
/etc/init.d and add it to a runlevel (e.g. default). This is done automatically
by the HalVM ebuild from the HalVM-website.


Starting HalVM (Other systems)
==============================

	HalVM is a daemon, which should be run by the root user. It's important
that it gets started after HAL and DBUS, and if you restart any of those then
HalVM needs to be restarted too.
